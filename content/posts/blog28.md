I started my job at Avataar close to 3 years back. I have been so caught up in work since then, that I didn't make time for many of the things which I love - reading, writing, maintaining friendships, building, jamming startup ideas, and so on.. I love my job (except the people management part!), and not finding time is to do with my indiscipline more than anything. I forgot I had a blog until one fine day when one of new joinees in my team reminded me of it (I was a little embarrased, given I write assuming no one will read.) Yeah, I write for myself. 

The last 3 years have been a hell of a journey, in which I learned so so much in multiple aspects of my life. I did occasionaly write my learnings and reflections in my Notion, and I'll start with posting them here. 

I am so excited to start writing again!
