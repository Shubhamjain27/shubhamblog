Uber and Airbnb are marketplaces that figured out how utilize an idle asset.

Airbnb turns spare bedroom into extra cash, Uber turns your car into extra income.

However, the most valuable asset in the world that’s underutilized isn’t cars or bedrooms--it’s people.

There are billions of people who’s talents are underutilized.

There are people with same IQ, same potential, getting paid 100x more because of where they live.

Many unicorns will be built off this “secret”.

Look at every job category in the US + ask “does it have to be here?”

Freelancing is broken. Remote Internships is broken. A Mturk for valuable skills is much needed.
