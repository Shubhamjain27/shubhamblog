On my last few birthdays, I have felt bad for not achieving anything up till that age. I have always expected myself to achieve something in life. I haven't until now.

What if on my 30th birthday, I am still not able to meet my expectations? I just dread at this thought, the same way I dread on my last birthday of not achieving anything today. And here I am, with lots of new experiences, wisdom, people. But not something I could be proud of.

I might never be satisfied with my whole life. Do I want to live that life? Maybe I need to give up the quest for achieving something. It's scary, but at least I might be able to live my life happily. Underpromise and over-deliver.
