“If you start taking cues from people playing a different game than you are, you are bound to be fooled and eventually become lost, since different games have different rules and different goals.”

Many times we tend to see our friends or first-degree network, and copy them. But we forget that your friends have different career aspirations.

Let’s say your friend watches a lot of TV Series. You are tempted to do so, rationalizing that entertainment is important in life. Perhaps he is not onto a career goal, if he has one.

Try to figure out what game one is playing, and if it matches with your path/goal. Don’t blindly follow anyone.

Try to find people in your field/what you hope to become, and try to be in their company. You are what your surroundings are — old but true af.

But before all this, take a step back and figure out your own game first. Or are you like a monkey jumping from one thing to another whatever more excites you? Or are you a dopamine jerk who lets social media to guide him through the day — one who doesn’t play any game at all? Figure out your true north, you won’t reach anywhere just sailing.
