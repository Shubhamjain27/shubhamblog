What makes Zoom IPO special is that when it started, Microsoft already acquired Skype of $8.5 billion. And Cisco acquired Webex(another popular video calling product) for billions. There were dozens of other competitors. Then how did Zoom beat them all?

Two reasons - 

1. Great Product - 

Eric, the founder of Zoom, was an early engineer in Webex. He knew how much could be improved in video confrencing products. Best products and not the first products win.

1. Big Market - 

A great product would have given it a enough success but not a market cap of over $20 billion. The video confrencing market is as big and the product is as horizontal as one can get.


I feel Notion fits both these criteria and will be at least as valued as Zoom.
