Hey There!

![](/media/goa.jpeg)

I am founder of Researchshala - a startup to help Professors in their research projects. Currently I am working on Alazia - a text automation product. 

I will be graduating in May 2019. I am deeply interested in AI and I will pursue it as my career. 

I am inspired by folks on Twitter who share so much of knowledge on daily basis. I am fortunate to learn from them early in my career. 

I have been living in Chandigarh, India since my birth. That said, I have travelled across India extensively.  

I love to talk to people, and if you want to strike a conversation - just hit me up and I will be more excited to take it forward. 

See you!
