My Principles â€“


1. Be on time always. 
2. Keep a distance from those who don't keep their words.
3. Don't chase fame. 
4. What I do is perhaps the most important thing for me. Over money, people and everything.
5. Few people in my life for whom I can do anything. Will not say no to them.
6. Self obsessed. I think I am the best.
7. Work on a balanced life - 3Cs- curiosity through reading books, creativity through side projects, calmness through meditation/religion.
